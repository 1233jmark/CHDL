# CHDL
Course Hero File Downloader. Free.

![](https://puu.sh/mnFsH/d2b9af6b23.png)

This script was hastily concocted. CHDL is a Chrome Extension that attempts to download full (unblurred) documents from Course Hero.

## Installation
The extension must be installed in Chrome's developer mode.

## Usage
You must be on a document page on CourseHero to use the extension from either the toolbar or the right-click context menu, and you must be signed in on the CourseHero website.
The extension only works due to a weird permission error on CourseHero's end that fails to check what files you should be able to access.

Try out the "Download all files from this course." option to start downloading relevant files - it shouldn't be more than a handful.
